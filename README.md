# Operating_Systems_2022
# Producer_Consumer Problem
# Utilizes Semaphoresand Pthreads

# Overview
This code uses 2 files to simulate the producer-consumer problem, using a static array of size 2 as the shared memory buffer. producer.cpp is the producer file which fills the buffer, and consumer.cpp is the consumer file, using and emptying the buffer. 

# Dependencies
This code utilizes pthreads and was creating in a Linux environment, so you may need to use a Linux environment to execute the code. 
Beyond that, the code should be pretty much plug-and-play.
